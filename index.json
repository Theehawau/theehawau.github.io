Phillips Exeter Academy 2016   Miscellaneous Interests My first year of undergrad, I was involved in Model United Nations (UCBMUN), helping to run a national collegiate conference as well as an emergency response historical committee. I was also involved with Berkeley ANova, which is a student organization that seeks to empower students by providing computer science education and mentorship to under-resourced schools and marginalized communities. I co-chaired the events committee that started their large-scale overnight hackathon for high school students in under-resourced communities for two years.\nFor all four years, I was also an avid participant in the Blockchain@Berkeley community, developing curriculum and teaching courses, mentoring other students and managing projects and doing technical ghost-writing and advising different start-ups. Currently, I contribute to Bitcoin and do technical ghost-writing for various blockchain start-ups.\nIn my free time, I also like to deviate from recipes, sing along to songs I don’t know the words to, occasionally go on long runs, and ponder other hypothetical careers like stand-up comedy. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve run the Golden Gate Half (Fall 2016), and the Bay Bridge Half (Spr 2019).\n Teaching Experience UIUC\n Teaching Assistant [CS101: Intro Computing] Spr\u0026rsquo; 21 \u0026ndash; 700 students, Excellent TA Award  Berkeley\n  Teaching Assistant [CCB Bioinformatics Bootcamp] Aug\u0026rsquo; 20 \u0026ndash; 100 students.\n  Reader [CS162 Operating Systems and System Programming] Su\u0026rsquo; 20 \u0026ndash; 400 students\n  Teaching Assistant [CS170 Efficient Algorithms \u0026amp; Intractable Problems] Spr\u0026rsquo; 19, Fa'19, Spr'20 \u0026ndash; 1k+ students\n  Reader [CS170 Efficient Algorithms \u0026amp; Intractable Problems] Fa'18 \u0026ndash; 1.5k+ students\n  Reader [CS70 Discrete Math \u0026amp; Probability] Fa'17, Spr'18, Su'18 \u0026ndash; 1.5k+ students\n  Teaching Assistant [Blockchain Fundamentals] Fa'17 \u0026ndash; 1k+ students\n  Course Administrator \u0026amp; Lecturer [Blockchain Fundamentals] Spr'18, Fa'18 \u0026ndash; 200+ students, largest recorded student-run course @ Berkeley\n  Course Advisor [EdX Blockchain Fundamentals] Spr'18 \u0026ndash; 170k+ students\n   Talks Given \u0026amp; Hackathons Won  TiE Inflect Apr 2018 Blockchain Bootcamp: Lecturer \u0026amp; Panelist EthDenver Feb 2018: bountyful EthWaterloo Nov 2017: citEthzen CalHacks 4.0 Oct 2017: Echoless Treehacks March 2017: Homebound Google Machine Learning Prize   Miscellaneous Media  Shield the Bay: winners of a booz allen foundation innovation fund grant Shield the Bay: featured by the ucb school of public health Projects and Privacy at ETHWaterloo: medium blogpost Sonic Hedgehogs: neuroscience blog She Hacks Alone: hackathon feature by huffpost National History Day Winner 2014: highschool   Other Interesting Experiences That aren\u0026rsquo;t on my resume\u0026hellip; Technical Ghostwriter\n [Ankr] [Aleo] [Sperax]  Technical Advisor [Berkeley Blockchain Accelerator] Fa'19\n Provided hands-on mentorship and technical expertise Generated entrepreneurship curriculum, hosted technical office hours  Technical Consultant\n Spr'17 Blockchain Supply Chain Proof of Concept for Airbus [Blockchain @ Berkeley] Su'17 Partnership with Iota [Blockchain @ Berkeley] Sp'18 - Fa'18 Independent Consulting Company [BlockSyda]  Legislative Intern [Office of Senator Maria Cantwell - D] Mar - June 2016\n Responsible for legislative memos Attending briefings, conferences and meetings on the senator\u0026rsquo;s behalf Constituent relations, as well as official tour guide  Volunteer English Teacher [Big Mountain Foundation] Jun - Sept 2013\n Lived on Dalan Mountain in rural China, staying with a host family Developed and taught English curriculum for the largest local school, for a summer class of 30 K-12 students   Selected Coursework Efficient Algorithms \u0026amp; Intractable Problems (3 time 170 Teaching Assistant), Computational Biology (176)\nOperating Systems (CS162), Computer Security (161), Computer Architecture (61C)\nArtificial Intelligence (188), Machine Learning (189)\nProbability \u0026amp; Random Processes (126), Advanced Linear Algebra (110)\nInformation Devices \u0026amp; Systems (16A), Discrete Math \u0026amp; Probability (70 Reader)\nOrganic Chemistry (CHEM3A), Intro Physics (8A)\n",

    "body": "UPP2 is a computational improvement on UPP, performing highly accurate and fast multiple sequence alignment.\nMotivation: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a basic step in many bioinformatics pipelines. However, achieving highly accurate alignments on large datasets, especially those with sequence length heterogeneity, is a challenging task. UPP (Ultra-large multiple sequence alignment using Phylogeny-aware Profiles) is a method for MSA estimation that builds an ensemble of Hidden Markov Models (eHMM) to represent an estimated alignment on the full length sequences in the input, and then adds the remaining sequences into the alignment using selected HMMs in the ensemble. Although UPP provides good accuracy, it is computationally intensive on large datasets.\nResults: We present UPP2, a direct improvement on UPP. The main advance is a fast technique for selecting HMMs in the ensemble that allows us to achieve the same accuracy as UPP but with greatly reduced runtime. We show UPP2 produces more accurate alignments compared to leading MSA methods on datasets exhibiting substantial sequence length heterogeneity, and is among the most accurate otherwise.\nTool is available here.

    "body": "CNAViz: User-guided local and global copy-number segmentation for tumor sequencing data\n(In submission)\nMotivation: Copy-number aberrations (CNA) are genetic alterations that amplify or delete the number of copies of large genomic segments. Although they are ubiquitous in cancer and subsequently a critical area of current cancer research, CNA identification from DNA sequencing data is challenging because it requires partitioning of the genome into complex segments that may not be contiguous. Existing segmentation algorithms address these challenges either by leveraging the local information among neighboring genomic regions, or by globally grouping genomic regions that are affected by similar CNAs across the entire genome. However, both approaches have limitations: overclustering in the case of local segmentation, or the omission of clusters corresponding to focal CNAs in the case of global segmentation. Importantly, inaccurate segmentation will lead to inaccurate identification of important CNAs.\nResults: We introduce CNAViz, a web-based tool that enables the user to simultaneously perform local and global segmentation, thus overcoming the limitations of each approach. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by several metrics, CNAViz yields more accurate segmentations relative to existing local and global segmentation methods. Moreover, we analyze six bulk DNA sequencing samples from three breast cancer patients. By validating with parallel single-cell DNA sequencing data from the same samples, we show that CNAViz\u0026rsquo;s more accurate segmentation improves accuracy in downstream copy-number calling.\nTool is available here, code implementation is available here, and screencasts and analysis files are available here.

    "body": "We provide face shields for Bay Area healthcare workers, focusing on institutions ignored by large- scale sourcing and donation efforts. Face shields are a critical component of personal protective equipment (PPE), providing essential barrier protection from SARS-CoV-2 containing aerosols and droplets for healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients.\nRecognizing the need of these institutions, we launched Shield the Bay in March 2020, crowdfunded $16,000 to provide 20,000 face shields. Our initial partner is Highland Hospital, a county hospital in Oakland and the primary trauma center in Alameda County, with the busiest emergency department in the United States. Our product is the primary face shield in use by nurses and certified nursing assistants in a number of Highland COVID units.\nHighland Hospital in Oakland is the largest hospital in the Alameda Health System, where 65% of patients are African American and Latino, more than 50% are uninsured, and one-third are on Medi-Cal (California’s Medicaid program). This hospital in particular has been hard-hit during the pandemic, and is under-resourced in part due to the enormous wealth disparity in Alameda County.\nOur face shield consists of a reusable visor, and cost-effective, easily replaceable transparent shields. Our human-centered design process has simultaneously engaged hospital administration and nurses. Four rounds of prototyping and testing in clinical environments resulted in a differentiated product in a crowded marketplace. Our face shield integrates with clinical workflows, gives nurses more confidence in safety compared to other donated and purchased products, is comfortable for long periods of use, eliminates the need for disinfection, is more cost effective per use than even the most basic alternatives, and results in less environmental waste.\nToday, Alameda County has the highest number of COVID cases and deaths in northern California. COVID has exacerbated the scarcity of supply for hospitals that serve less affluent communities and communities of color: a majority of nursing staff and patients are African American, Latino, Filipino, and mixed race.\n Sustained demand for various PPE will persist for 12-18 months, roughly doubling as traditional health services are restored. In this environment, our goal is to catalyze a new marketplace, engaging various small local businesses in manufacturing our proven product design and connecting them with the procurement arms of healthcare systems. We will build lasting community resilience by helping Bay Area health systems to safely serve communities most in need while establishing an alternative means of producing high-quality PPE that supports local businesses.\nWe are a collaborative with deep professional expertise in healthcare, industrial and user-centered design, and health equity: private sector design-manufacturing partners COSMO and Newman Design; scientists, faculty and students from UC Berkeley\u0026rsquo;s Colleges of Chemistry, Public Health, and Engineering; and infection control and system logistics leadership at Bay Area county emergency response systems.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been working with Jessica Granderson (Ph.D), Sean Miller (M.F.A., COSMO), Catherine Newman (Ph.D, Newman Design), Jaspal Sandhu (Ph.D, UC Berkeley School of Public Health) and Michael Zuerch (Ph.D, UC Berkeley Department of Chemistry).\nYou can find out more and/or help support us towards our goal at this gofundme.\nA huge huge thank you to all of my friends and family who have supported us towards this goal.

With this basic spatial setting, we cluster hierarchically the populations: starting from having each node in it’s own “cluster”, and going up to all the points belonging to the same cluster group.\nIn doing so, we increase the population size to keep that variable constant across scenarios.\n![convergence.jpg]\nAfter generating different levels of aggregation, we run a gene drive construct. In this case, we are using MCR with different configurations $[H_{fitness},B_{fitness},F_{deposition}]$ to test various fixation speeds.\nAfter running MGDrivE, we display de results of the simulation runs to look at the qualitative differences in the systems’ responses.\n This video illustrates how the code was used:\n\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t end up getting to present this, because the conference was cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thus, PoS based blockchains have the potential risk of being forked with a minimal cost for double spending. In this paper, we propose a PoS protocol that is secure against long range attack based double spending. The security is achieved using secure randomness beacons generated by tamper-proof hardware modules.\n [2020 February] Sperax: An Approach to Defeat Long Range Attacks in Blockchains (IEEE) (Yongge Wang, Jingwen Sun, Xin Wang, Yunchuan Wei, Hao Wu, Gillian Chu, Zhou Yu)\n",
