      <description>Sperax: An Approach to Defeat Long Range Attacks in Blockchains
 [Abstract]
Since Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s seminal work of achieving consensus under the assumption that more than 51% computational power is honest, many researchers have proposed various kinds of consensus protocol.s In recent years, there has been a trend in designing proof of stake (PoS) based consensus protocols.
